# Quiz-Game-Application
This JavaFX-based Quiz Game Application allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, tracks their score, and displays results. Questions are hardcoded (with a commented file-loading option) and presented via a GUI with buttons for answer selection. The program uses loops to iterate through questions, conditionals to check answers, and JavaFX for an engaging interface. It’s a great project for practicing OOP, file handling, and GUI development.

# Features:

- Displays one question at a time with four answer options.
- Tracks and updates the user’s score based on correct answers.
- Shows a final score screen with a summary.
- Supports file-based question loading (commented out for simplicity).
- Responsive GUI with JavaFX buttons and labels.
